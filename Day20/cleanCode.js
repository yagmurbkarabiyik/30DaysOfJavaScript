/*
- camelCase for variables and functions
- choose to const for constants, arrays, objects and functions. Instead of double quote, we 
choose to use single quote or backtick.
- also removed semicolons 
- space around arithmetcic operators, assignment operators and after comma
- arrow function instead of function declaration(If we need to this keyword we should use function declaration bcs arrow 
    function does not have this keyword)
- make array names plural (numbers, countries, skills)
